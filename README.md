# VendingMachine
C Project done to simulate a vending machine which is running infinitly to prompt users for their currency and amount of coins that they have, in return for a drink from the machine.
The main reason for this assignment was to learn how to script on C.
Alongside avoiding code duplication, duplication can cost a lot of maintanence cost.
Due to that a lot of this code was made independently so if there was a change in currency or limits etc. they would only be updated once. (In the preprocessing section #define)
